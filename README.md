K-means Clustering is one of the simplest unsupervised algorithm used to cluster unlabeled data. It is usually one of the first clustering algorithms taught to a student wishing to learn machine learning algorithms. The purpose of creating this interactive tutorial was to teach the function of k-means algorithm in a more visual and intuitive way, rather than the traditional textual way. Our Martini glass structured tutorial first gives the reader, a brief step by step and easy to understand tutorial and then allows the user to experiment with the parameters used in k-means clustering algorithm.
